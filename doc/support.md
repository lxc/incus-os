# Support
## Releases
IncusOS uses a rolling release model.

A new stable release is tagged at least once a week to pick up the latest bug fixes to the Linux kernel, Incus and any other component that we ship.

When reporting an issue, please first ensure that your system is running the latest stable release.

```{note}
The use of other update channels like `testing` isn't supported and should be limited to development and debugging use on non-critical systems.
```
