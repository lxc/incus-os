                Updates the list of encryption recovery keys. At least one recovery key must always be
                specified. Keys must be at least 15 characters long, contain at least one special
                character, and consist of at least five unique characters. Some other simple complexity
                checks are applied, and any key that doesn't pass will be rejected with an error.

                Optionally, specify one or more PEM-encoded custom CA certificates that should be added
                to the system's root trust. Only certificates specified in the API call will be persisted.
