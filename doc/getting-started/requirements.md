IncusOS is designed to provide an extremely secure environment in which to
run Incus. It requires a lot of modern system features and will not function
properly on older unsupported systems.

Minimum system requirements:

- Modern Intel/AMD (`x86_64`) or ARM (`aarch64`) system
   - For `x86_64`, the CPU must support `x86_64_v3`
- Support for UEFI with Secure Boot
- {abbr}`TPM (Trusted Platform Module)` 2.0 security module
- At least 4GiB of RAM (for system use only)
- At least 50GiB of storage
- At least one wired network port
